# Webcam-Barcode-Scanner
Barcode detection with Deep Learning (YOLO) and decoding barcode using Pyzbar in Python
Our repo is compatible with YOLO versions V3, V4, V5, and V7. You can check out the models we successfully trained [here](https://github.com/Tyan-Ng/Webcam-Barcode-Scanner/releases/tag/Barcode-detection-models) using our collected [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7465864)

In the training notebook, we focus exclusively on YOLOv5. For other versions, please refer to the official repositories provided by their respective authors.

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€The study was a collaborative effort involving [Tyan-Ng](https://github.com/Tyan-Ng) and [TaThanh200320](https://github.com/TaThanh200320)

## Installation
Clone repo and install requirements.txt
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tyan-Ng/Webcam-Barcode-Scanner
cd Webcam-Barcode-Scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Visit the [**pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) homepage to install the torch library suitable for your hardware
## Usage
```bash
python barcode_reader.py
```

## Training
**1. Data preparation**

Download the images (train, val, test) and labels for our [BarcodeEpu2](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7465864) dataset

Our dataset contains over 3000 barcode images that have been labeled in the YOLO format, making it easy to use for training and testing computer vision models that can detect and decode barcodes.

**2. Train**

Our training is based on the YOLOv5 model (Check out our [notebook](https://github.com/Tyan-Ng/Webcam-Barcode-Scanner/blob/main/train.ipynb) to learn how to train a model)

The barcode detection model was trained in several other versions of YOLO ([see](https://github.com/Tyan-Ng/Webcam-Barcode-Scanner/releases/tag/Barcode-detection-models))
